# Blackpixel

Very small X binary to act as an anchor process for an extremely bare-bones Xorg setup

This binary is designed to be pretty much as small as an X binary can be. All it does is render a 10x10 pixel black square and sit there holding the fort while other X binaries run.

## Why?!
This was designed for the mm-install script (see [https://github.com/tfischer4765/mm-install]) to act as a stand-in for the non-existent window manager.
